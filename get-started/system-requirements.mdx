## <Icon icon="shield" /> Security Requirements

### Administrator Privileges
Apex Automation requires elevated permissions to:
- Simulate keyboard and mouse inputs
- Monitor game window states for template detection
- Write configuration files to system directories

### Anti-Virus Considerations
Most anti-virus software may flag automation tools. You may need to:
- Add Apex Automation to your anti-virus whitelist
- Temporarily disable real-time protection during installation
- Create security exceptions for the installation folder

### Essential Settings
- **Window Mode**: Windowed (required - press **Alt + Enter** in-game)
- **Resolution**: Any resolution works (bot auto-resizes to 1280x720)
- **Graphics Quality**: Any setting that maintains stable gameplay

### Recommended Settings
- **HUD Settings**: Default HUD layout and text size for best detection
- **Input Device**: Keyboard & Mouse
- **Keybinds**: Default keybinds recommended (custom binds may cause issues)

- **Game Restart**: Automatically relaunches the game when needed
- **State Management**: Intelligently navigates menus and handles errors
- **24/7 Grinding**: Keeps your account progressing around the clock

### Built-in Safety
- **Human-like Patterns**: Randomized timing and movement to appear natural
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive crash detection and recovery systems
- **Window Management**: Automatic focus and resize handling
- **Template Detection**: Reliable visual state recognition

## <Icon icon="help-circle" /> Troubleshooting

If you experience issues:
1. **Verify game runs normally** in Windowed mode
2. **Check anti-virus settings** - whitelist the bot if needed
3. **Run as Administrator** - required for input simulation
4. **Update graphics drivers** if template detection fails
