Apex Automation is the ultimate Call of Duty XP farming bot designed for players who want to maximize their progression without the time commitment. Whether you're looking to level up your rank, unlock weapons, complete battle pass tiers, or farm event XP — Apex Automation handles it all automatically.

<Info>
Apex Automation never modifies game files or accesses game memory — it's a completely surface-level tool that works just like a human player would.

## What is Apex Automation?

Apex Automation is a sophisticated, surface-level automation tool that simulates human-like keyboard and mouse inputs to play Call of Duty for you. It uses computer vision and AI routines to:

- Navigate menus automatically
- Play game modes with intelligent behavior
- Handle crashes and restart the game
- Grind XP 24/7 without user input

## How It Works

1. **Visual Recognition** — Template matching to identify game states  
2. **Intelligent Decisions** — Context-based responses and mode logic  
3. **Human-like Input** — Randomized keyboard/mouse behavior  
4. **Error Handling** — Detects and recovers from issues  
5. **Full Automation** — From boot-up to shutdown
