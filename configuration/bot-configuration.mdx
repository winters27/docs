## 1. Game Path Setup

Specify where the Call of Duty executable is located so the bot can launch and monitor the game.

<Info>
  Navigate to the Apex Automation settings and locate the <strong>Game Path</strong> field. Use the file picker to select your Call of Duty shortcut or executable.
</Info>

## 2. Start/Stop Hotkey

Assign a custom hotkey to quickly toggle the bot on and off during gameplay.

<Tip>
  Choose a hotkey combination that doesn’t interfere with in-game actions. Modifier keys like <code>Ctrl</code>, <code>Alt</code>, or <code>Shift</code> are recommended.
</Tip>

## 3. Game Mode Selection

Select the desired game mode (e.g., Prop Hunt, Plunder, Battle Royale). The bot will automatically queue into this mode using in-game navigation.

<Callout icon="gamepad">
  Make sure the selected mode is supported and available in your game’s current playlist.
</Callout>

## 4. Squad Fill Option

Enable this if you want the bot to automatically disable **Squad Fill**, allowing you to solo queue in modes like Resurgence or Battle Royale.

<Info>
  This is useful for minimizing variables during automation and improving consistency.

## 5. Prestige Handling

When enabled, the bot will automatically enter the next **Prestige** when you reach the max level, allowing it to continue earning XP without user intervention.

<Callout icon="trophy">
  Turn this on if you're planning to run the bot unattended for long sessions.
</Callout>

## 6. Loadout Cycling

The bot can automatically rotate through loadouts between matches, helping you level up more weapons per session.

<Tip>
  This is especially powerful when grinding camo challenges or trying to level up multiple weapons efficiently.
