title: 'Game Shortcut Path' description: 'How to find and configure the game shortcut path for Apex Automation.'
Why Create a Shortcut?

Apex Automation needs the file path to your Call of Duty game shortcut (.lnk or .url file) to launch the game correctly via the selected launcher (Steam, Battle.net, or Game Pass).
Battle.net Instructions

    Click your Windows key and type Call of Duty.

    Right-click the result and choose Open file location.

    Note: You might see two shortcuts. Ensure you select the one that does not mention Steam.

    Right-click the correct Call of Duty shortcut and select Copy as path.

    Paste this path into the 'Cod Path' field in the Apex Automation Configuration tab.

    IMPORTANT: The pasted path will have double quotes (") at the beginning and end. You MUST remove these quotes.

    Ensure the final path in the config field ends with .lnk or .url.

Steam Instructions

    Open your Steam client.

    Go to your Library.

    Find Call of Duty in your games list.

    Right-click on it, navigate to Manage, and click Create desktop shortcut.

Game Pass (Xbox App) Instructions

    Open the Xbox App on your PC.

    Find Call of Duty in your installed games list.

    Click the [...] button and go to Manage.

    Select the General tab and click CREATE DESKTOP SHORTCUT.
