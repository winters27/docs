## Best Mode for Overall XP

### Prop Hunt (Black Ops 6)

Prop Hunt is by far the most effective mode for **account-level XP farming**. Here's why:

- **Fast and consistent match cycles**
- **No need to get kills** — XP is earned through survival and match participation
- **Simple AI requirements** — easier for the bot to run error-free
- **Minimal risk of detection** due to low combat activity

  Prop Hunt is the best choice if your goal is to level up your account, complete seasonal tiers, or grind prestige ranks automatically.

## Best Modes for Weapon XP

### Warzone Modes (Resurgence, Battle Royale, Plunder)

If your focus is leveling **weapons**, Warzone is the place to be — especially:

#### Plunder (Preferred)

- **Immediate Loadout Access** off spawn
- **Longer Matches** = more XP per run
- **Low pressure respawn system** — great for XP cycling

#### Resurgence / Battle Royale

- **Good for bot uptime** with reliable flow
- Resurgence allows for **aggressive short loops**
- BR is slower, but supports longer-term grinds

<Info>
  All Warzone modes benefit from using **Double Weapon XP Tokens** and enabling **Loadout Cycling** in the bot settings to maximize gains.

## Recommended Settings

To maximize XP output across modes:

- Enable **Loadout Cycling** to level multiple weapons
- Use **XP Tokens** (bot applies them automatically)
- Set **Game Mode** based on your focus:
  - **Prop Hunt** for overall XP and ranks
  - **Plunder** or **Resurgence** for weapon XP
- Turn on **Prestige Handling** to keep the grind going even at max level

---

## XP Token Management

The bot will:
- Check if tokens are available
- Apply the correct token automatically based on the selected mode
- Track token duration to prevent overlap or waste

## Summary

| Objective       | Best Mode       | Why                                |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Account XP     | Prop Hunt        | Fast matches, low error risk        |
| Weapon XP      | Plunder          | Immediate loadouts, long matches    |
| Event Grinding | Warzone Modes    | Supports special challenges/tokens  |

<Tip>
  If you're leaving the bot on overnight or for long stretches, go with **Prop Hunt**. If you're actively checking in and want to level weapons fast, go with **Plunder**.
