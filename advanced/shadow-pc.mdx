Shadow PC is a cloud-based Windows machine that lets you run Apex Automation and Call of Duty remotely â€” freeing up your local computer for other tasks. It works seamlessly through their desktop app or even a browser.

## Why Use Shadow PC?

<Info>
  Running the bot on Shadow PC allows full automation without impacting your local resources. It's great for 24/7 grinding, especially if you want to keep your personal machine available for work, streaming, or gaming.

## 1. Set Up Your Shadow PC

Follow these steps to get started:

<ul>
  <li>
    Visit <a href="https://shadow.tech/shadowpc/offers" target="_blank">Shadow PC Offers</a> and create an account.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure your location is set to <strong>US</strong> (top-right corner) for better pricing and availability.
  </li>
  <li>
    Choose a plan with sufficient specs â€” typically the <strong>Boost</strong> tier is enough (~$30/month), but check current offerings.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>International users</strong>: You may need a US billing address. Sites like <a href="https://www.fakexy.com/fake-address-countries" target="_blank">FakeXY</a> can generate addresses, but use with caution â€” this may violate Shadowâ€™s policies. Some payment methods may still work with generated data.
  </li>
</ul>

<Warning>
  Be mindful of Shadow's terms of service when using fake billing details.
</Warning>

  <li>Update your graphics drivers via <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/drivers" target="_blank">NVIDIA Driver Downloads</a>.</li>

  After downloading the bot to your Shadow PC, be sure to <strong>run it as Administrator</strong> for full control and performance.

## Tips for Stability

- **Keep your resolution under 4K** â€” 1920x1080 works best for visual recognition.
- **Avoid multitasking on Shadow** while the bot is running.
- **Use wired internet or strong Wi-Fi** to maintain stable cloud performance.
- **Enable auto-start** in Shadowâ€™s settings if you want unattended operation.
