# Welcome to Apex Automation

Apex Automation is the ultimate Call of Duty XP farming bot designed for players who want to maximize their progression without the time commitment. Whether you're looking to level up your rank, unlock weapons, complete battle pass tiers, or farm event XP, Apex Automation handles it all automatically.

## What is Apex Automation?

Apex Automation is a sophisticated, surface-level automation tool that simulates human-like keyboard and mouse inputs to play Call of Duty for you. Using advanced computer vision and template matching, the bot can:

- **Navigate menus** automatically to start matches
- **Play different game modes** with intelligent AI routines
- **Handle errors and crashes** with automatic recovery
- **Restart the game** when needed without user intervention
- **Grind XP 24/7** while you sleep, work, or do other activities

### How It Works

The bot operates by:
1. **Visual Recognition**: Uses template matching to identify game states and UI elements
2. **Intelligent Decision Making**: Processes current game state and determines appropriate actions
3. **Human-like Input**: Simulates realistic keyboard and mouse movements with randomization
4. **Continuous Monitoring**: Watches for errors, crashes, and state changes
5. **Automatic Recovery**: Handles problems and restarts without user intervention

<Info>
Apex Automation never modifies game files or accesses game memory - it's a completely surface-level tool that works just like a human player would.
